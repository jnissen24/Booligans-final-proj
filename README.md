How to Play the Game:
  Objective:
    - Play all of your cards before the computer opponent plays all of their cards
  Game Set Up:
    - Each player begins with 20 cards (15 face down cards and 5 cards visible and in your "hand")
    - Then, two cards are placed face up in the middle of the screen (These are the cards you will make your moves on)
    - The remaining cards are then split into two 5 card piles that stand on both sides of the two middle cards
  Game Play: 
    - If you have a card in your hand that is +1 or -1 either of the cards in the middle, you can play that card!
      (Example! If one of the middle cards is a 4, you can play either a 3 or a 5. Or if it's an Ace, you can play a 2 or a King) 
    - Once you play a card, you will automatically draw from your reserve deck until you run out of cards, i.e. win! 
    - At the same time, the computer is working to get rid of all their cards as well so time is of the essence :[]
    - If you cannot play out of the 5 cards visible, you must wait until your opponent plays a card that you can use, 
      or, if it seems like you both are stuck, you may press the 6 key to flip over two new cards into the center. 
  How to Play Cards
    - Use your computer keys to play! Keys correspond to the visible cards, in order, from left to right. 1 corresponds 
      to the first card, 2 to the second, 3 to the third, 4 to the fourth, and 5 to the fifth. Again, if you cannot play 
      and your opponent isnâ€™t going, hit the 6 key to flip over two new central cards.
